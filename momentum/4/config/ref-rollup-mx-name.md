## Name

rollup_mx_name â€” specifies the destination domain to route mail to when doing MX rollup

## Synopsis

`rollup_mx_name = "somedomain.com`

## Description
This option specifies the destination domain to route to when using the MX rollup feature for a destination.  A more complete description of MX rollup is given in the rollup_mx section.

In the following example configuration, mail sent to either "node1.somedomain.com" or "mail.nobody.com" will be routed to "otherdomain.com", and any Adaptive Delivery settings for "otherdomain.com" will control the delivery.

```
Host "node1.somedomain.com" {
  rollup_mx = true
  rollup_mx_name = "otherdomain.com"
}

Host "mail.nobody.com" {
  rollup_mx = true
  rollup_mx_name = "otherdomain.com"
}
```

### Note

The rollup_mx_name option works in conjunction with the rollup_mx option to implement the MX Rollup functionality.

## Scope

rollup_mx_name is valid in host scope.  This can be specified in host, binding, or binding group scopes.
