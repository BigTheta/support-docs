## OnGage

When you sign up with [OnGage](http://www.ongage.com), there is a link at the very top of the screen called ESP Setup. Click on that, and it will take you to the OnGage Setup Wizard:

Step One

1.  Under Tell us what you’d like to do: select the radio button that says: “I want to find the ESP I am currently using, or already have an account with”
2.  Search for My ESP – type in SparkPost and click on Search
3.  It will then bring up a list that may fit your description. Check the box beside your choice, and click on Save & Next Step.

Step 2:

1.  Type in your Account Name
2.  Email Attributes: Define your ‘From Name’, ‘From Address’ and ‘Reply Address’ that will appear in the emails you send to your subscribers. Remember, your From Address MUST match the sending domain you’ve set up. 
3.  You can add different email addresses and select which you’d like to use as default. You can also add which list you would like SparkPost to send to, if there is one specific list.

1.  API Credentials – Go back into SparkPost, and into Account/API & SMTP
2.  Under the API Key Name, name the API key in a way that you will remember, for instance, OnGage.
3.  Choose with permissions you’d like your API to have.
4.  Put in your SparkPost account password, and click on Save.

    9\. Back in Ongage, where it asks for the API Host, put in api.sparkpost.com, and in the box below, put in your API       Key that we got from SparkPost. You can then choose to verify the credentials. If you have another SparkPost account with a different domain, you can add it here as well, under Add Account. 

1.  Click Save & Next Step

Step 3

This will involve your domain information.

1.  Add your tracking domain. For example, track.myawesomedomain.com
2.  Define your image hosting domain, if you have one
3.  Lastly, check your domain verification
