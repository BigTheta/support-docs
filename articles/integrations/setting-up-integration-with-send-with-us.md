Step One:

1.  If you log into [SendWithUs](http://www.sendwithus.com) and go to Delivery Settings, it asks for the Outgoing Address Settings. There you will put in your From email address, your From name, and your Reply-To email address.  Save your settings.
2.  Click on Add ESP Account.

1.  A window will open, where you can name your new Account. You can then select which ESP from the drop down, and of course that one is SparkPost. It will then ask you for your API key, so put that in.
