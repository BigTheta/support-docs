SparkPost Signals is an analytics suite that helps you improve email performance by diagnosing health issues before they impact your business. It analyzes your email sending and benchmark data from across our industry-leading email network to provide data-driven, predictive, and actionable insights that help you increase open rates, prevent blacklisting, and boost inbox placement.

## Dashboard
The dashboard contains leaderboards for the three signals provided: Health Score, Spam Trap Monitoring, and Engagement Recency. 

Each of row in these tables contains the summary for a different subaccount, and can be further sliced by campaign, IP pool, or sending domain to help catch issues across any of these facets. Additionally, you can view the data for up to 90 days to analyze trends over time.

Dive into the details page to see a deeper view of your scoring and find curated actions you should take to improve your sending, deliverability, and engagement.

_**Note:** Unlike SparkPost metrics which are calculated based on the number of sent emails, Signals is calculated based on the number of injected emails. Because of this, you'll see differing rates for some components such as hard bounces._
