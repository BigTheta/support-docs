If you have your email tracks and clicks set to on in SparkPost, this screen will show you the impact your email has had on your recipients.

This is a really good view to look at the effectiveness of your campaigns.

As well, below, it shows you which links in your emails were clicked the most, which is also very valuable information:
Here you can see the links, as well as how many raw clicks and clicks occurred. Raw Clicks occur when a recipient clicks on that link in an email the first time. Clicks are ANY time a recipient clicks on a link in an email, regardless of whether they had clicked on that link previously or not. Thus, Clicks will probably always be either the same or higher than Raw Clicks.

If you are a free customer, your plan amount is 10,000 emails per month. That’s not the entire story, however. We have both hourly and daily limits as well. On a free account you can send up to 1000 per day.
There are a few reasons why we do this, but ultimately it all comes down to Reputation – that of SparkPost, as well as yours.

So what is Reputation?

In the email sending world, Reputation is pretty much everything. It affects how fast your emails get accepted by recipient domains, whether your emails get bounced, or if they make it into the inbox rather than the spam folder. There are a few things we do on the back end to ensure this doesn’t happen, however, a lot of it is up to you.
Message Systems and SparkPost send 25% of the world’s legitimate emails. We are very proud of this, and want to go even higher. We cannot, however, if we are also sending a lot of illegitimate emails. And what are those?

**Spam**

Unsolicited email is a huge issue and we’re working hard to keep spammers out of SparkPost. That is why with our free accounts we allow up to 1000 sent per day. If a spammer does sign on with SparkPost, there is not a lot of damage they can do with a free account.

But say you are a customer in good standing, and you’re happy with the monthly sending limits; you would like to increase your hourly or daily limits.

This is where Trust comes in.

**Trust**

Trust is basically like a credit score. It is how well regarded your sending is viewed in the sending community. How you can achieve this is covered in the 2 articles below:
