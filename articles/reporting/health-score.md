Your Health Score is a predictive score to help you monitor your email health and identify problems before they surface in your normal metrics. Each day, the Health Score model predicts your overall engagement as compared with all senders using SparkPost, by analyzing dozens of different sending factors from your bounce rate to the relationship you have with your recipients. You'll receive a score between 0 and 100, informing you of your sending health. A good score is anything above 80.

_**Note:** To provide the actionable insights and accurate analysis, the Health Score requires a minimum 1000 emails sent each day.  For any period where your sending does not pass these minimums, you will not have a Health Score._

### Components

The Health Score is a combination of twelve different components which are informed by all the message events generated by your sending each day. You can drill into these components for any given day's Health Score.
The relative size of the component in the chart indicates the impact it has on your health score.
