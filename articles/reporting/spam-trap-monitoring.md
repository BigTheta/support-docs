TODO: WHAT ARE SPAM TRAPS

TODO: WHY ARE THEY BAD

With visibility across multiple commercial and non-commercial spam trap networks for the broadest coverage in the industry, SparkPost Signals is a crucial resource for maintaining the health of your email. Spam Trap Monitoring reports the share over time of your total email volume that was sent to known spam traps for each given day. This indicator is important to take note of since an excessive rate of spam trap hits indicates poor list procurement and hygiene practices. You can view the spam trap hits as a raw number or a ratio over the number of injections for that day.

_*Note:* If you send to a high percent of spam traps, your report will be empty to protect the spam trap addresses. This will only affect spammers and senders with extremely poor practices._

## Trap types

Spam traps are categorized into different types based on their behavior and the way they can end up on your list.

Knowing the type spam trap you’re sending to can helu you find where your email program may have an issue.

* **Recycled** - Email addresses that once were real, but have been converted into a spam trap. If you have these on your list it’s probably a sign you need to clean out old unengaged recipients. You can look at your engagement recency cohorts (EU) to see if you are sending to a lot of unengaged recipients.
* **Typo** - Email addresses hosted on a domain that looks like a real mailbox provider, like gmal.com. These usually get onto your list when a real person tries to sign up but “fat fingers” their email address and accidentally adds a trap instead. These addresses signal that you should work to improve your enrollment process. Using a tool like Recipient Validation can help solve this problem.

* **Parked** - These are email addresses hosted by a parked domain provider. These addresses can point to list quality issues, though they will not affect your reputation.
