## Best Practices for Reputation

One of the most important things for email deliverability is sending reputation. You must have a good IP and domain reputation in order to be identified as a legitimate sender and reach your customers’ inbox. Below are some Dos and Don'ts that can help you improve your reputation.

## Do:

*   Ensure your infrastructure is secure.
*   Confirm your sending domain contains valid DNS record types and can receive emails.
*   Provide multiple IP addresses based on reputation and purpose.
*   Display meaningful information in the Subject, From, and Reply-to fields.
*   Implement email validation systems such as Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM).
*   Set up and frequently monitor “postmaster” and “abuse” mailboxes.
*   Sign up for Feedback Loops with all major ISPs and quickly act on complaints.
*   Manage your marketing lists. Keep them clean and up-to-date, and either re-engage inactive users or remove them from your list.
*   Remove individuals who unsubscribed from your email campaign.
*   Pay attention to bounces.

## Do Not:

*   Send without testing and proofreading.
*   Hide the sender or use a misleading subject line.
*   Hide the unsubscribe link or ignore unsubscribe requests.
*   Buy email lists.
*   Sell your list to a third party without permission.
