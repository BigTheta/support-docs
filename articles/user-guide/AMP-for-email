This guide describes the steps you’ll need to follow to start sending AMPHTML content. We'll run through content setup and best practices to have in place before you begin sending. We'll also point out some useful resources along the way to help you get the best from SparkPost, such as our [SparkPost API documentation](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/).

AMP, commonly known for developing fast web pages on mobile clients, is a set of HTML tags backed by JavaScript with a focus on performance and security.
The AMPHTML Email format provides a subset of AMP components, like carousels, responsive form elements, and the ability to retrieve fresh content, that can be included into email messages. Recipients of AMP emails can view and interact with the AMP components directly in the email message, all within the inbox.

Note: SparkPost is available in multiple regions. "SparkPost" refers to the SparkPost service hosted in North America. "SparkPost EU" refers to the SparkPost service hosted in Western Europe. An account created with SparkPost cannot be used with SparkPost EU, and vice-versa. Customers may use accounts in both regions.

## The AMPHTML Email Format

### Required Markup

The following code represents the minimum amount of markup that makes up a valid AMP email message:
'''json
<!doctype html>
<html ⚡4email>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <style amp4email-boilerplate>body{visibility:hidden}</style>
  <script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
Hello, world.
</body>
</html>
'''

An AMP email must have:

| Rules |   Description   |
| --- | --- |
| Start with the '<!doctype html>' doctype|Standard for HTML | Standard for HTML |
| Contain a top-level '<html ⚡4email>' tag ('<html amp4email>' is accepted as well) | Identifies the document as AMPHTML Email |
| Contain '<head>' and '<body>' tags | Optional in HTML but not in AMPHTML Email |
| Contain a '<meta charset="utf-8">' tag as the first child of their '<head>' tag | Identifies the encoding for the page |
| Contain the amp4email boilerplate in the '<head>' :
'<style amp4email-boilerplate>body{visibility:hidden}</style><script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>' | CSS boilerplate to initially hide the content until AMP JS is loaded |
