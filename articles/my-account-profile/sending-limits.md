 **### Sending Limits**                 
SparkPost not only has monthly sending limits with each package, but it also has daily and hourly limits as well.

You can find your limits by going into Accounts, and then Usage:

![](webkit-fake-url://64e6fdd7-5e48-44b3-8434-4a4040cebf1b/image.tiff) 

The sending limits break down below:

| **Account Type**      | **Hourly** | **Daily** | **Monthly** |
| Free | 100 | 1000 | 10,000 |
| Bronze | 1000 | 10,000 | 100,000 |
| Silver | 4000 | 20,000 | 400,000 |
| Gold | 10,000 | 50,000 | 1 mil |
| Platinum | 20,000 | 100,000 | 2 mil |
|   |   |   |   |

 **Please note**     : *if you go over your limit, the emails are NOT queued for inclusion in your next send. They are dropped from the server and will need to be added to the next list.*                                                                                                                                                                

For more information on understanding your account limits, there is a great blog post [here](https://blog.sparkpost.com/understanding-your-account-limits-on-sparkpost/?_ga=1.219843738.2061439738.1428348386): 

With our free account, if you send over your daily/hourly/monthly limit, there is a hard stop. You will get an error stating that you are over your specified limit

With paid plans, there is no hard stop after your limit is reached, until you have sent 50% or more of your monthly total. There is an additional charge, however, per email sent.

You can also customize your plan, as well as adding dedicated IPs by contacting our [Sales team](mailto:sparkpostisr@messagesystems.com).

## How Limits Work

Hourly and daily limits are rolling limits. As an example, if you send your hourly limit at 3:15 pm, you will be able to send again at 4:15 pm.

With daily limits, it’s a bit more complicated. Say you’re on a Gold Plan, and you sent 50,000 emails yesterday in increments of 10,000 per hour, at 1 pm, 2 pm, 3 pm, 4 pm, and 5 pm. Today, you won’t need to wait until 5 pm to send your first 10,000\. You will be able to do so 24 hours after the first increment was sent, at 1 pm.

Monthly billing is set to your own particular billing cycle, so if you sign up on the 13<sup>th</sup> of the month, and reach your monthly limit, you will be able to send again on the 13<sup>th</sup> of next month.

## Upgrading your Plan

You’ve tried your free account, and you have decided that SparkPost meets all of your sending needs. However, the free account isn’t enough to send to your entire mailing list. You can upgrade your account by going into Account, and then Billing:

There, it will show you which account you are on presently, and the pricing of all of the other plans that are available. Based on your sending needs, you should be able to find a plan that fits. If not, please contact our Sales team, and they will be able to customize a plan for you.
