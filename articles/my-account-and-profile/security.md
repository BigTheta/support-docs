SparkPost provides two-factor authentication as an option.

In the Account/Security screen, click on Enable.

1.  First, if you haven’t already, download a two-factor authentication app. Then, use the app to scan the QR code. (We recommend [Duo](https://www.duosecurity.com/), [Google Authenticato](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en)r etc. Here are some [more](https://www.google.com/#q=two+factor+authentication+software) if those don’t appeal to you)  
2.  The app will then provide you with a 6 digit code you put into the field above, and click ENABLE.  

It will then take you to the following screen:
