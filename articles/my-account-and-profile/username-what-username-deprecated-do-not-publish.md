## Where is My Username?

When you first signed up for SparkPost, you filled out a form, like below. 

![](media/username-what-username-deprecated-do-not-publish/username_original.png)You'll see that the Username is just above the Password and Confirm Password fields. This is what you need to sign in, NOT your email address. 

If you cannot remember what you put for a Username, please contact Support, and we will help you find it. We are working on getting a Lost UserName page up alongside the Lost Password field, and that should be up fairly soon.
