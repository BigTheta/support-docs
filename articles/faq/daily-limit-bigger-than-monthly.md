In certain situations you may see in the SparkPost Application that your daily limit is larger than your current plan's monthly limit. For example if you have downgraded from a much larger plan or moved from one of our older plans. We leave this limit in place so if you upgrade you can use this larger limit without the need to request it through the application

In this situation the **monthly** limit takes precedence and you will be allowed to send to your monthly limit in a single day. Injections in excess of this monthly limit would be rejected.

Should you wish to send more than this current monthly limit please consider upgrading to one of our larger plans via the [Account/Billing](https://app.sparkpost.com/account/billing) page.
