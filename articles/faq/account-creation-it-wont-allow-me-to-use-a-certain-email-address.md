If you tried to sign up to SparkPost with an email address and received the following error:

"Uh oh! We are unable to send emails to this email address. Please choose an alternate email address or email support@sparkpost.com."

 The reason why is because the email address you used is on our Global Suppression List. SparkPost automatically blocks generic email aliases that spammers attempt to send to, such as marketing@emailaddress.com, or info@emailaddress.com, support@emailaddress.com, etc. If you get this message, it's because you are attempting to use one of those. We recommend either using a personal email address, or if you wish to create an account that a team can access, try creating an alias such as sparkpost@emailaddress.com.
