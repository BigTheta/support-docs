title: “What happens if I don’t use my SparkPost account?”
description: “If you don’t send from your SparkPost account for 365 days we will close your account”

We love it when customers use SparkPost, but we recognize that things can change, and you might no longer need your account for sending. We strongly recommend that you contact support through the in app support tool to request your account is closed. Details can be found [here](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/faq/submit-a-ticket/), but if you don’t, to protect your account’s security and any data we will close your account after 365 days of inactivity.

If you want to start using sparkpost again, you will be asked to set up a new account. You can find more information on account set up [here](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/getting-started/getting-started-sparkpost/).
