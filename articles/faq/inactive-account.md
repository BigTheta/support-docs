title: “What happens if I don’t use my SparkPost account?”
description: “If you never send from your account, after 3 months we will close your account, or if you don’t send from your SparkPost account for 6 months we will close your account”

We love it when customers use SparkPost, but we recognize that things can change, and you might no longer need your account for sending. We strongly recommend that you contact support through the in app support tool to request your account is closed. Details can be found [here](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/faq/submit-a-ticket/), but if you don’t, to protect your account’s security and any data we will close your account...

<ul>
  <li>If you have never sent with your own verified domain your account will be closed after 3 months.</li>
  <li>If you have stopped sending we will close your account after 6 months of inactivity.</li>
  </ul>

If you would like to start using SparkPost again, you will be asked to set up a new account with one of our current plans. You can find more information on account set up [here](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/getting-started/getting-started-sparkpost/).
