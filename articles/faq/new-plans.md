If your sending patterns have not changed, you will be able to stay on your existing plan indefinitely. When you grow beyond your current sending tier, our prices are industry-leading  and will support your growth while providing the best service, support, and deliverability in the industry.

Note: Once you have selected a new plan you can only switch to those plans currently available, this includes the current Free/Developer plan, you will not be able to return to your old plan.
