**I put my sending domain, abc.com into the Domain Name field, however I typed it as abd.com. How can I delete it?**                                                                                                               

We now have the ability for you to edit and delete your sending domains in the UI!Â 

If you look to the far right of your sending domain, you'll see the word Edit, as well as a gear, along with a trash can. If you make any changes to any existing domains, remember you will need to reconfigure your SPF and DKIM, if you haven't already. The trash can will remove the domain permanently.
