Your monthly cost will remain the same for the lifetime of your account. However, your overages will be capped at your maximum sending from the last 90 days or the published plan volume, whichever is the greater. If you intend to send more than your limit, we’d encourage you to take advantage of the discounts, and upgrade your account.

For example if you are on a 1M plan and have the following sending pattern for the last 90 days:
* Aug 19 to Sep 18: 1,136,456
* Jul 20 to Aug 18: 1,232,012
* Jun 20 to Jul 19: 986,472

We would set your max monthly limit to 1,232,012 as this is the larger value than the plan value.


** Please note **
Free accounts which have never overaged or have not added a credit card to their account are not affected by this change. These accounts will continue with a maximum monthly limit of 100K and their current daily limit.
